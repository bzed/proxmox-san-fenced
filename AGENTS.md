# pve-san-fenced project

The goal is to develope a SAN fencing daemon for proxmox, including variouys helper tools.

## General coding requirements:

- When using format! and you can inline variables into {}, always do that.
- Always collapse if statements per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#collapsible_if
- Always inline format! args when possible per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#uninlined_format_args
- Use method references over closures when possible per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#redundant_closure_for_method_calls
- Avoid bool or ambiguous `Option` parameters that force callers to write hard-to-read code such as `foo(false)` or `bar(None)`. Prefer enums, named methods, newtypes, or other idiomatic Rust API shapes when they keep the callsite self-documenting.
- When you cannot make that API change and still need a small positional-literal callsite in Rust, follow the `argument_comment_lint` convention:
  - Use an exact `/*param_name*/` comment before opaque literal arguments such as `None`, booleans, and numeric literals when passing them by position.
  - A method's sole non-self argument is exempt when the method and parameter names match, such as `.enabled(false)` for `fn enabled(&self, enabled: bool)`.
  - Do not add these comments for string or char literals unless the comment adds real clarity; those literals are intentionally exempt from the lint.
  - The parameter name in the comment must exactly match the callee signature.
  - You can run `just argument-comment-lint` to run the lint check locally. This is powered by Bazel, so running it the first time can be slow if Bazel is not warmed up, though incremental invocations should take <15s. Most of the time, it is best to update the PR and let CI take responsibility for checking this (or run it asynchronously in the background after submitting the PR). Note CI checks all three platforms, which the local run does not.
- When possible, make `match` statements exhaustive and avoid wildcard arms.
- Newly added traits should include doc comments that explain their role and how implementations are expected to use them.
- Discourage both `#[async_trait]` and `#[allow(async_fn_in_trait)]` in Rust traits.
  - Prefer native RPITIT trait methods with explicit `Send` bounds on the returned future, as in `3c7f013f9735` / `#16630`.
  - Preferred trait shape:
    `fn foo(&self, ...) -> impl std::future::Future<Output = T> + Send;`
  - Implementations may still use `async fn foo(&self, ...) -> T` when they satisfy that contract.
  - Do not use `#[allow(async_fn_in_trait)]` as a shortcut around spelling the future contract explicitly.
- When writing tests, prefer comparing the equality of entire objects over fields one by one.
- Do not add tests for values that are statically defined.
- Do not add negative tests for logic that was removed.
- Generate docstrings and manpages for the tools you create.
- Prefer private modules and explicitly exported public crate API.
- Do not create small helper methods that are referenced only once.
- For tracing async work, instrument the function or method definition with
  `#[tracing::instrument(...)]` instead of attaching spans to futures with
  `.instrument(...)` at call sites. Before adding instrumentation, check whether the callee—or
  the implementation method it immediately delegates to—is already instrumented.
- Avoid large modules:
  - Prefer adding new modules instead of growing existing ones.
  - Target Rust modules under 500 LoC, excluding tests.
  - If a file exceeds roughly 800 LoC, add new functionality in a new module instead of extending
    the existing file unless there is a strong documented reason not to.
  - When extracting code from a large module, move the related tests and module/type docs toward
    the new implementation so the invariants stay close to the code that owns them.
- When running Rust commands (e.g. `just fix` or `just test`) be patient with the command and never try to kill them using the PID. Rust lock can make the execution slow, this is expected.
- Avoid trailing whitespaces. Empty line should only have a linebreak and not be filled with spaces.

## Testing

- Proper testing of all created code is required. If code depends on the availability of available tools, those tools and their output will be mocked.
- If there is test data missing, document this in an errata document for each test case.
- Never edit the content of the test-data directory, it contains data coming from real-life programs to test the code with.
- Mocking daemons should never listen on the same sockets as their real world examples.

## GIT

- Always commit your changes with an appropriate description.
- Never edit/squash/ammend old commits, either revert them or commit fixes with an appropriate description.
- Commits: First line is a short summary, <= 70 characters. Then an empty line, long description follows then. Be verbose and precise.

## Planning

- Create a plan before implementing it. With the brain of a QA agent, review your plan. Implement your plan.
- Compare your implementation with the originally generated plan, if the plan was not properly implemented, keep working.

## Versioning

- Use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.
